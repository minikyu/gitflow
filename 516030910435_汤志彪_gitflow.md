# **Git Workflow**
***
## **what is git?**

* Git is used for version control.
* Git is the most advanced distributed version control system in the world.

### **git workflow**
![workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minikyu/gitflow/master/gitflow.png)
* a programmer creates a branch from the master in git, then fixes bugs or adds new content in the branch. The modification doesn't change the codes in the master. After testing the codes in the branch, the programmer can merge codes into the master. this is the way that git realize version control.

## **How does git work?**
 ***
 1. **Create a breach**

* When you add features or fix bugs, you can create a new branch, which will not affect the main branch *master*. So it is safe to try and submit changes. When the code is reviewed and runs through, you can incorporate it into the master branch.
***
 2. **Commit information**

* Commit information is a notable thing. When you submit the code, Git will track code changes and corresponding committed information. This is contact records of your work. When your friend refer to code, clear committed information will make them quickly understand what you do, and why to do so.
***
 3. **Merge branches**

* The name of the main branch of Git is called *master*. It is automatically created, and after the repository is initialized, it is the default that it happens in the main branch. In the daily work, when you need to add new features, you can merge anther branch into the master branch.

* **git merge branch_name**: 
By default, git will execute "fast forward merge", directly merge the *branch_name* branch into master branch, and not retain the development record of branch_name branch.

* **-no-ff (no fast foward)**:
 After the use of -no-ff (no fast foward)  parameter, a commit record will be added to the master branch and the development record of branch_name branch will be retained. The future code analysis will be convenient.
***
4. **Resolve conflicts during merging branch**

* Sometimes the merging doesn't go so well. If you modify the same part of the same file in different branches, Git will not be able to merge the two together. It can only be solved by hand.

## **Why to use git?**

* Each developer can have a local copy of his entire project. Isolated environment makes each developer's work and modification in other parts of the project separated - free to submit to their own local warehouse, completely ignore the upstream development, until feedback the modification.

* Git provides strong branching and merging models. Unlike SVN, Git branches are designed to be a "fail-safe" mechanism for integrating code and sharing modifications among repositories.
